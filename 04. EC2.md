# EC2

web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud
it's VM in the cloud
pay for capacity that you use

## Options
* On Demand: pay by the hour
* Reserved: reserve capacity 1yr to 3yr term. cheaper
* Spot: bid whatever price you want for instance capacity. if you have flexible start and end times
* Dedicated hosts: physical EC2 server (can also pay by the hour). useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization

# EBS (Elastic Block Store)
storage volume that you attach to EC2

* SSD
  1. General purpose (GP2): SSD, 3 IOPS per GB
  2. Provisioned IOPS SSD (IO1): used for DB. if you need more than 1000 IOPS
* Magnetic Storage
  1. Thourghput Optimized HDD (ST1): bid data, data warehouse, log processing. cannot be a boot volume
  2. Cold HDD (SC1): low cost. file server. cannot be a boot volume
  3. Magnetic (standard): lowest cost

you cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS

LAB:
*one subnet == one availability zone*

log in with
`ssh ec2-user@54.159.86.27 -i MyEC2KeyPair.pem `

install apache
`yum install httpd -y`

start apache
`service httpd start`

automatically restart apache
`chkconfig httpd on`

to check volume in instance
`lsblk`

attach instance
`mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdb`
mount it
`mkdir /acloudguru
mount /dev/xvdb /acloudguru`


* termination protection is off by default, you must turn it on
* on EBS backed instance, the default action for root EBS volume is to be deleted when instance is terminated
* EBS root volume of defaul AMI cannot be encrypted

## EBS Encryption
- Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted.
- Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are also automatically encrypted.
- Public snapshots of encrypted volumes are not supported, but you can share an encrypted snapshot with specific accounts
- There is no direct way to encrypt an existing unencrypted volume, or to remove encryption from an encrypted volume.

### Apply Encryption While Copying a Snapshot
Because you can apply encryption to a snapshot while copying it, another path to encrypting your data is the following procedure.
To encrypt a volume's data by means of snapshot copying:
- Create a snapshot of your unencrypted EBS volume. This snapshot is also unencrypted.
- Copy the snapshot while applying encryption parameters. The resulting target snapshot is encrypted.
- Restore the encrypted snapshot to a new volume, which is also encrypted.

# Security Group Basics

* any change to a rule in the Security Groups applies IMMEDIATELY
* any inbound rule always add an outbound rule (Security Groups are STATEFUL)
* all inbound traffic is blocked by default
* all outbound traffic is allowed

### Upgrading EBS Volume Types

change underground storage device
---------------------------------
stop mySQL service
unmount volume
detach from EC2 instance
create snapshot
create new volume and restore from snapshot



* EBS Volumes can be changed on the fly (except for magnetic, you have to stop EC2 instance and create a snapshot and create volume from snapshot)
* best practice to stop EC2 instance
* if you change volume on the fly you have to wait 6 hrs before making another change
* you can scale EBS volumes up only
* volumes must be in the same AZ as EC2

### RAID, Volumes and Snapshots

RAID: redundant array of independent disks
 - RAID 0: striped, no redundancy, good performance
 - RAID 1: mirrored, redundancy
 - RAID 5: good for reads, bad for writes (not recommended by AWS)
 - RAID 10: striped & mirroring, good redundancy and good performance

 if you don't get good I/O from volume, use RAID 0 or RAID 10

 take a snapshot of RAID array?
 - freeze file system
 - unmount RAID array
 - shut down EC2 instances

# AMI (amazon machine image)

with EBS you can stop the instance
with instance store you can only reboot or terminate

for fast provisioning you want to use EBS backed volume
Instance Store Volumes == Ephemeral Storage

Standard Monitoing = 5 minutes
Detailed Monitoring = 1 minute

Cloudwatch is for performance monitoring

# Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)

- instances monitored by ELB are inService or outofService
- have their own DNS name, no IP

Cloudwatch is for monitoring (CPU utilization)
Cloudtrail is for auditing  (create new user, role, new s3 bucket)

## AWS Command Line and EC2

login in to instance with ssh
then
`aws configure` (and get the access key and secret access from IAM)
then
`aws s3 ls`
or
`aws ec2 describe-instances`

## Using IAM roles with EC2

Roles are GLOBAL

S3 CLI (command life interface)
===============================
you CAN attach a role to an EC2 instance with aws console or CLI


## Metadata

metadata url: curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

## Placement Group
Logical group of instances within a **single availability zone**. like adhoop clusters or cassandra nodes.
very low network latency (10GB network) and high throughput
- it can't span multiple availability zones
- the name must be unique in my aws account
- only certain type of instances can be launched
- aws recommend homogenous instances within placement groups

# Elastic File System (EFS)

File storage service for EC2. storage capacity is elastic.
- supports the Network File System 4
- pay for the storage you use
- can scale up to petabytes
- can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections
- data is stored across multiple AZ within a region
- read after write consistency (like S3)
- it's BLOCK base storage and not OBject based storage

it's a file server. can apply user level permissions.

# Lambda

compute service where you can upload your code and create lambda functions. AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers.
it can be used:
- as an event driven compute service where AWS Lambda runs your code in response to events.
- as a compute service to run your code in response to http requests using Amazon API gateway or api calls to aws sdks.

Languages
- node.js
- C#
- Java
- Python

Priced by
- requests: first 1 million requests are free. $0.20 per 1 million thereafter
- duration (max 5 minutes)

Cool:
- no servers
- continuous scaling
- super cheap

Practical use case: amazon echo/alexa

Lambda scales out
Lambda functions are independent
Lambda is serverless
AWS X-ray can help debug

## Summary

minimize cost: use SPOT
fairly stable web site: use reserved
scale up quickly: on demand
