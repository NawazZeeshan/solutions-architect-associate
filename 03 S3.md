S3
===
object storage: safe place to store files in the cloud
objects based: videos, photos, flat files
not a file system, or blob based storage

data spread across multiple devices and facilities
files can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
files are stored in buckets (a folder)
S3 is a universal name space

Data consistency model for S3
-----------------------------
**Read after Write** consistency for PUTS of new objects
**Eventual consistency** for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take time to propagate)

S3 is object based:
* Key (name),
* Value (data),
* VersionID,
* Metadata,
* Subresources (Access Control Lists, Torrent)

built for 99.99% availability and 11 9 durability guarantee
Tiered storage available
Lifecycle management
Encryption (different methodologies)
Secury data with Access Control List and Bucket policies

S3 storage classes:
* S3 99.99% availability
* S3 - IA (infrequently accessed)
* S3 RRS Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS)
* Glacier (very cheap) but used for archival

Glacier is for data archival, very cheap but takes a few hours to retrieve

Once version is turned on, it cannot be removed, it can only be disabled

Cross Region Replication
------------------------
- if you enable cross region replication between 2 buckets, existing objects are NOT replicated only NEW and UPDATED ones
- versioning must be enabled on both source and destination
- you cannot replicate to multiple buckets
- delete markers are replicated

Lifecycle Management Lab
------------------------
- can be used in conjunction with versioning
- transition to standard after 30 days (128Kb and 30 days after the creation date)
- archive to Glacier 30 days after IA
- permanently delete

S3 Request Headers
------------------
Content-Length
x-amz-meta
x-amz-storage-class
Content-MD5


# Cloudfront CDN

Edge Location: location where content is cached. different from AWS region and availability zone. There are over 50

Origin: origin of all files, could be S3 bucket, EC2 instance, an ELB or route 53

Distribution: collection of Edge locations
- Web Distribution: used for web siteds
- RTMP: used for Media streaming

Edge location are not just READ only, you can write to them too
Objects are cached for the life of TTL (time to live)
You can clear cached objects (but you will be charged)


Securing Buckets
----------------
by default buckets are private
setup access control by
- bucket policy
- access control list

S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs to another bucket or another AWS account


Encryption
----------
5 different methods:

* in transits
  - SSL/TLS (https)

* at rest
  - Server side encryption
    1. S3 Managed Keys SSE-S3
    2. AWS Key Management Service; SSE-KMS (provides audit trails)
    3. Server Side Encryption with customer provided keys SSE-C
  - Client Side Encryption

Storage Gateway
---------------
available for download as a Virtual Machine to install on a host in my data center

4 types of storage gateway:
- File Gateway (NFS): store flat file in S3
- Volume Gateway (iSCSI): virtual hard drive
  1. Store volume: exact copy of your dataset
  2. Cached volume: most recent access data
- Tape Gateway (VTL): archive and backup solution

File Gateway
------------
Files stored in S3 and access through NFS (word, pdfs, image, video)

Volume Gateway
---------------
block based storage like OS or SQL Server (virtual hard disk)
Snapshots are incremental
- Store Volume: entire copy of dataset and asynch backup to AWS S3 from 1GB to 1TB. it's a virtual hard disk of copy on site that is backed up to S3
- Cached Volume: keep the most frequent access data on site and the rest in S3. 1GB to 32TB

Tape Gateway
------------
use tape infrastructure to create tape backups


# Snowball

lots of data e.g.:1TB, send hard disk to AWS and bypass internet

snowball: peta-byte scale data transport solution. 80TB snowball in all regions.

snowball edge: is a 100TB data transfer with compute capabilities. like a small AWS data center. you can run lambda function from it. it's compute capacity as well.

snowmobile: for peta-byte and exa-byte data. it's a truck. moves extra large data

import/export is old version of snowball where you send in hard drives

with snowball you can import to S3 and export from S3

## S3 Transfer Acceleration

transfer to edge location instead of region to make transfers faster


## Create a static website

turn on in bucket properties
serverless
cheap, scales automatically
static only
